                "ai_response": "Type 2 diabetes is a chronic metabolic condition characterized by high blood sugar levels due to insulin resistance and/or insufficient insulin production. This form of diabetes accounts for approximately 90% of all diabetes cases worldwide and has become increasingly prevalent across different age groups.\n\n## Type 2 Diabetes Overview\n\nType 2 diabetes develops when the body becomes resistant to insulin or when the pancreas cannot produce enough insulin to maintain normal blood glucose levels. Unlike type 1 diabetes, which is primarily an autoimmune condition, type 2 diabetes is strongly associated with lifestyle factors and genetic predisposition.\n\n**Key Risk Factors:**\n- Overweight or obesity\n- Physical inactivity\n- Family history of diabetes\n- Age (risk increases with age)\n- History of gestational diabetes\n- Race/ethnicity (higher risk in certain populations)\n\n## Age Distribution of Type 2 Diabetes\n\nThe prevalence of type 2 diabetes varies significantly across age groups, with a clear pattern of increasing prevalence with advancing age.\n\n### Children and Adolescents\nWhile traditionally considered an adult disease, type 2 diabetes is increasingly diagnosed in younger populations. This concerning trend is largely attributed to rising childhood obesity rates. In 2017-2018, approximately 5,300 youth were newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in the United States. Though this number is growing, the prevalence remains much lower in children compared to adults.\n\n### Young Adults (18-44 years)\nYoung adults represent a growing segment of the type 2 diabetes population. According to CDC data from 2017-2020, approximately 5.8 million Americans aged 18-44 had diabetes (both diagnosed and undiagnosed), with about 3.5 million having received a diagnosis.\n\n### Middle-Aged Adults (45-64 years)\nThis age group shows a significant increase in diabetes prevalence. CDC statistics indicate that 15.8 million Americans aged 45-64 had diabetes during 2017-2020, with 12 million having received a diagnosis. Currently, adults aged 40-59 represent the age group with the highest diabetes rates globally.\n\n### Older Adults (65+ years)\nThe highest prevalence of type 2 diabetes is found among older adults. CDC data shows that 16.5 million Americans aged 65 or older had diabetes during 2017-2020, with 13.8 million having received a diagnosis. Approximately 25.9% of adults aged 65 or older have diabetes, compared to just 0.26% of those under 19 years of age.\n\n## Trends in Diabetes Prevalence by Age\n\nThe age-adjusted prevalence of total diabetes has significantly increased among adults aged 18 years or older during 2001-2020. This trend is observed across all age groups but is particularly pronounced in older adults.\n\nInterestingly, projections suggest that by 2030, the highest global diabetes rates will shift from the 40-59 age group to the 60-79 age group, reflecting aging populations worldwide and improved survival of individuals with diabetes.\n\n---\n**Sources:**\n* Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Diabetes Statistics Report\n* International Diabetes Federation\n* World Health Organization (WHO)\n* Healthline health information on type 2 diabetes statistics"
