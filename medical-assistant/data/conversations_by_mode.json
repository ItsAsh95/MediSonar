While most fevers resolve within 1-3 days[2], prolonged cases may indicate underlying infections (viral/bacterial), inflammatory conditions, or other systemic issues[1][4]. Given the severity described, **urgent clinical evaluation is strongly recommended** to rule out serious causes like:\n\n- Bacterial infections (e.g., pneumonia, urinary tract infections)\n- Viral syndromes (e.g., influenza, COVID-19)\n- Inflammatory disorders[2]\n- Rare but serious conditions like meningitis or endocarditis[4]\n\n**Immediate next steps:**\n1. Monitor temperature patterns (document exact readings)\n2. Check for accompanying symptoms like chest pain, breathing difficulties, or rash\n3. Seek emergency care if experiencing:\n   - Confusion\n   - Stiff neck\n   - Difficulty breathing\n   - Persistent vomiting Possible conditions: Severe febrile illness requiring differential diagnosis including infectious and non-infectious etiologies. Not a diagnosis."
