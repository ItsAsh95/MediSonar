                "ai_response": "## How Type 2 Diabetes Affects People\n\nType 2 diabetes is a chronic condition that impacts how your body metabolizes glucose (sugar), a vital energy source. In this condition, either the body becomes resistant to insulin or the pancreas does not produce enough insulin. Insulin is the hormone responsible for helping glucose enter your cells for energy. When insulin doesn't work properly, glucose builds up in the bloodstream instead of being used by the cells.\n\n**Key Effects on the Body:**\n- **High Blood Sugar:** Persistent high blood sugar levels can damage blood vessels and nerves throughout the body.\n- **Heart and Blood Vessels:** Increased risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, and atherosclerosis (narrowed blood vessels).\n- **Kidneys:** Damage to the small blood vessels in the kidneys can lead to kidney disease or failure.\n- **Eyes:** Risk of diabetic retinopathy, which can cause vision loss or blindness.\n- **Nerves:** Nerve damage (neuropathy) can cause pain, tingling, or loss of sensation, especially in the feet and hands.\n- **Feet and Skin:** Poor circulation and nerve damage can lead to slow-healing sores, infections, and in severe cases, amputation.\n- **Other Organs:** Diabetes can also affect the stomach (gastroparesis), sexual health, mouth, and ears.\n\n**Symptoms and Complications:**\n- Frequent urination, increased thirst, fatigue, blurred vision, slow-healing wounds, and increased susceptibility to infections are common symptoms.\n- If left untreated, type 2 diabetes can lead to severe complications, including heart attacks, strokes, kidney failure, and blindness.\n\n**Management:**\n- Type 2 diabetes can often be managed or delayed with lifestyle changes such as healthy eating, regular physical activity, and maintaining a healthy weight. Medication or insulin therapy may be required for some individuals.\n\n## Prevalence of Type 2 Diabetes by Age Group\n\nType 2 diabetes is more common in older adults, but rates are rising among younger age groups due to increasing obesity and sedentary lifestyles. The prevalence increases significantly with age.\n\n### Estimated Prevalence by Age Group\n\n| Age Group      | Estimated Prevalence (%) |\n|----------------|-------------------------|\n| 18\u201344 years    | 3%                      |\n| 45\u201364 years    | 13%                     |\n| 65+ years      | 21%                     |\n\n*These figures are representative estimates based on data from major health organizations such as the CDC and WHO. Actual prevalence may vary by country and population.*\n\n## Visualization: Type 2 Diabetes Prevalence by Age Group\n\nBelow is a bar chart illustrating the estimated prevalence of type 2 diabetes among different age groups:\n\n---\n**Sources:**\n- Mayo Clinic: Type 2 diabetes \u2013 Symptoms and causes\n- Cleveland Clinic: Type 2 Diabetes \u2013 What It Is, Causes, Symptoms & Treatment\n- CDC: How Diabetes Can Affect Your Body Infographic\n- MedlinePlus: Type 2 diabetes \u2013 Medical Encyclopedia\n- Healthline: The Effects of Diabetes on Your Body"
